# CasinoFinalProject

This is a simple project, coded in Java, I created to try to incorporate a real-life aspect into my code. 
This project features a RFID scanner simulator, which works with a real-life RFID scanner as well. 
Users can scan their RFID as if they were "checking in" to a casino, where they can play several games. 
The games will award virtual money, and the user's money will be stored in their RFID. 

Again, just a simple project used to explore some of Java's basic features (most notably, inheritance, methods, access modifiers...)
